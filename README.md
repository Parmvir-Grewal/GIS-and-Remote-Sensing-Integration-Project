# Urban Sprawl Research Project
This is a research project on the impact of urban sprawl on Halton Region's demographics and physical environment, which was overseen by me. Our project utilized a multi-faceted approach, combining satellite imagery, spatial and non-spatial data, and advanced analytical tools to develop a detailed understanding of the effects of urban sprawl.

## Research Objectives
The research project had the following objectives:

- To quantify the extent of urban sprawl in Halton Region
- To understand the impact of urban sprawl on the region's demographics and physical environment
- To identify strategies for mitigating the negative effects of urban sprawl

## Methodology
The research methodology involved the following steps:

- Collecting and analyzing satellite imagery, spatial and non-spatial data on Halton Region
- Using NDVI, NDBI, and supervised classification maps to quantify the extent of urban sprawl
- Conducting statistical analysis on the impact of urban sprawl on the region's demographics and physical environment
- Developing a set of recommendations for mitigating the negative effects of urban sprawl

## Results
The research project yielded the following results:

- Quantification of the extent of urban sprawl in Halton Region
- A comprehensive understanding of the impact of urban sprawl on the region's demographics and physical environment
- Development of a set of recommendations for mitigating the negative effects of urban sprawl, including strategies for more sustainable urban development

## Conclusion
The urban sprawl research project has provided valuable insights into the effects of urbanization on Halton Region's environment and demographics. We hope that our findings and recommendations will be used by policymakers and urban planners in the region to promote more sustainable urban development practices.
